Most of Eakins's paintings after 1886 were portraits, but he returned to sporting subjects in the late 1890s with a series that he began after attending professional boxing matches at the Philadelphia Arena (then located at the intersection of Broad and Cherry Streets, diagonally across from the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts). The resulting canvases were as revolutionary in their subject matter as his rowing scenes had been more than two decades earlier.
Eastman Johnson's depictions of rural life appealed to a widespread sense of nostalgia in the American post-Civil War era.
Mrs. Frishmuth (18421926) was a passionate collector of antique musical instruments and early American artifacts, textiles, and samplers, many of which are now in the Philadelphia Museum of Art. In 1897, she gave a large part of her collection to the museum at the University of Pennsylvania (now the University Museum). Eakins very likely hoped that his grand portrait would be acquired by the university to hang with her donation. The university did accept the painting on loan, but eventually returned it to the artist after Eakins removed it repeatedly to send to other exhibitions.
Suzanne Santje (1873-1947) was a Philadelphia-born actress who studied music in Berlin and drama in Paris. Eakins shows her not on stage but during a private moment in her study, dressed in a vibrant gown and surrounded by objects, including a script of the romantic drama
Best known for his stylish portraits, Sargent experimented in landscape painting throughout his career, but did so with increasing frequency after the turn of the twentieth century. Several trips to Italy and Switzerland resulted in Impressionist views of glacial streams and rocky terrain. In
Homer's painting cleverly refers to the rising American temperance movement, a crusade against drinking alcohol, by depicting a stout milkmaid pausing while a farmhand drinks from her ladle. Swaying under the weight of her pail and squinting into the sun, she presents the ideal of natural womanhood. Her powerful presence, marked by broad shoulders, muscular arms, and sunburned skin, counters the farmhand's relaxed stance and shaded face, visually reversing traditional gender roles. Far from flirting, the two figures awkwardly avoid each other's gaze, modeling rural wholesomeness and rectitude.
Henry Benbridge's scene, which derives from the Greek epic tradition on the Trojan War, is one of the most baroque compositions painted in the Delaware Valley during the eighteenth century. The painting is a copy, in reverse, of a tapestry design by Peter Paul Rubens (Flemish, 1577-1640). In the painting, Achilles has been disguised as a woman and hidden among the daughters of King Lycomedes at the behest of his mother, who knows that he is fated to die if he goes to Troy. Achilles betrays himself by showing too much interest in a helmet and becomes one of Greece's great warriors.

Renowned artist Winslow Homer was an avid sportsman and his outdoor subjects reflect an unsentimental view of the conflict between man and nature. In this scene set in the Adirondack region of New York State, earthen colors link the hunter and the environment, making it difficult to distinguish the man from the hill behind him. Homer visited the Adirondacks as one of many vacationers who flocked there in the late nineteenth century. The huntsman in Homers painting is not a visitor but rather a local trapper or guide who has caught a deer and is carrying off its pelt, antlers, and, likely, a pack full of meat.
Philadelphia art critic Christian Brinton---who donated his extensive collection of modern paintings, sculptures, graphic arts, costumes, and textiles to the Philadelphia Museum of Art in 1941---was a major advocate of Philadelphia-area artists. Impressed by Horace Pippin's contributions to the annual open exhibition at the West Chester Art Association in 1937, Brinton organized a solo exhibition of Pippin's work, which propelled the artist from relative obscurity to national fame. Shortly thereafter, Pippin painted this portrait, an example of his distinctive ability to combine the navet of self-taught art with modern painting techniques.

The figures in this meticulously executed scene respond with a variety of emotions to a plan by Petruchio to subdue his argumentative new wife. Proclaiming that her new dress is not good enough, he threatens the tailor. Katharina's atypical composure suggests Petruchio's success in  taming  her temper. Best known for biblical history pictures, romantic portraits, and landscapes, Allston was also a poet and novelist. His interest in Shakespeare undoubtedly was stimulated by his close friendship with Shakespearean scholar Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Not long before this picture was painted, the two men had toured Italy, where Allston learned to emulate the lustrous glazes and jewel-like colors of Venetian painting.
Enoch Edwards (17511802) was a Philadelphian who trained as a physician and served as a surgeon in the Continental Army (the colonial army formed during the American Revolutionary War). This group portrait commemorates his marriage to the half-sister of Henry Benbridge, who painted the scene. Benbridge depicts himself, along with Dr. Edwardss sister, on the couples left, clothing the bride in a luxurious form of imaginary dress employed by many eighteenth-century artists. Benbridge had traveled to Rome and London to study but returned to his native Philadelphia in 1770. A composition of this type, portraying an informal gathering of family or friends, is called a conversation piece.

Horace Pippin began to paint in earnest in the 1930s, combining the navet of the self-taught artist with an awareness of modern painting styles. World War I, in which he sustained a crippling arm wound, provided a frequent subject for his work, as did childhood memories and religious subjects. Human rights and social issues also often figure in his pictures, but
The dramatic rescue from a foundering ship shown here was made possible by a recent innovation in lifesaving technology, the breeches buoy. Secured firmly to ship and shore, the device permitted the transfer of stranded passengers to safety by means of a pulley that was hauled back and forth by crews at either end. Cropped down to its essentials, Homer's composition thrusts us into the midst of the action with massive waves rolling past, drenching the semiconscious woman and her anonymous savior.
A tiny ship on the horizon is dwarfed by the breakers beating the shoreline near Homers studio in Maine.
Transatlantic travel looks like fun in Homers recollection of his own trip to France in 186667. Stylish passengers stroll the deck, read, doze, uncork bottles, and inspect the marine life via telescope, seemingly unfazed by the steep tilt of their vulnerable, wooden world. Employed as an illustrator of topics from modern life, Homer had a sharp eye for fashion, leisure activity, and pretty girls. He envisions a bachelors paradise, where attractive young women abound and flirtatious winds expose a well-turned ankle.
American Rockingham wares were popular in the Unites States from the mid-nineteenth through the early twentieth centuries. The term  Rockingham  derives from an English factory on the estate of the Marquess of Rockingham that produced ceramic objects from 1745 until 1842. The factory became known for its mottled manganese-brown glazes and for its relief-molded decorations, often in the revived Rococo style (characterized by the use of leaf and flower motifs, curves and sinuous lines, and organic forms). When pottery manufacturers in the eastern United States and Ohio began to produce wares with similar glazes and designs in the early nineteenth century, the objects became known as  American Rockingham. 
In 1835 the Pennsylvania Assembly voted to incorporate the Tucker and Hemphill Factory as the American Porcelain Company. Thomas Tucker continued to manage the new concern, which produced the same porcelain wares as before, with few stylistic changes, until its closing in 1837.

This chair was likely commissioned for the Philadelphia residence of George and Martha Washington and served as the prototype for a suite of similarly designed chairs commissioned for and still on view at their Mount Vernon estate in Virginia.
This fire screen, used to block direct heat from an open hearth, was one of four ordered by John Cadwalader for his home in Philadelphia.
The Cadwalader family commissioned this easy chair as part of a suite of furniture for their Second Street house in Philadelphia. With its curved rails, sharply angled knees, hairy paws, and sensuous carved ornament, it closely corresponds to the other pieces of Cadwalader furniture in the Museum's collection. The upholstery and trim was a lavish display of wealth and taste.

Eero Saarinen's  Pedestal  chair, introduced in 1957, was an instant success. This  Champagne  chair is one of the many variations on that design created in the late 1950s and 1960s.
This clock, one of a series designed by George Nelson Associates for the Howard Miller Company, has become an icon of 1950s design. When the series was introduced, the clocks were considered quite radical-unlike traditional clocks, their faces had no numbers.

Pearlie Posey quilted at night after working all day in the fields, making her quilts from the skirts of old dresses that she tore into panels. (She recalled that four or six  skirt tails  sewn together made a quilt top.) Posey focused on quilting quickly and expediently, sewing the panels together with large stitches and thread that she unraveled from flour sacks. She used simple piecework patterns such as Nine Patch, Four Patch, and strips in her quilts until 1980, when she began making appliqu quilts, following the example of her daughter, Sarah Mary Taylor.

A resident of Yazoo City, Mississippi, Pearlie Posey used templates made by her daughter, Sarah Mary Taylor, for her own appliqu quilts and, because of failing eyesight, relied on her to cut out the shapes. She liked to mix the figures in each block and connect them with strips of colorful fabric. Posey traced the gymnasts on this quilt from a pantyhose advertisement; she copied the central figure in a coat from another advertisement. She learned to quilt from her grandmother, a former slave, and continued to quilt throughout her life. She remembered that during her childhood piecing and quilting were community activities. Families would get together to tear up old clothes and overalls for quilt tops and on Sunday mornings the women would gather at one house to quilt.

Known as the  Mama of Dada,  Beatrice Wood began her long artistic life among Dada circles in Paris and New York, where she was associated with Marcel Duchamp and Man Ray. Wood first began working in ceramics in her forties, after moving to Ojai, California, where she became fascinated with the luster glazes used by Persian and Mediterranean potters, and studied the technique with Otto Natzler. Over a fifty-year career, she continued to experiment with different luster effects, marrying sumptuous colors and shimmering surfaces to bold, simple vessels. Chalice typifies the intentionally naive, unschooled quality that Wood sought in her work.

Interested in designing a stylish, inexpensive chair, Rashid borrowed the curves, open spaces, and translucent polypropylene material from his  Garbo  wastebasket to create  Oh.  When introduced in January of 1999 at the price of forty-five dollars, the chair found a ready market; fifty thousand  Oh  chairs sold in the first three weeks of availability.
Made of a metal alloy originally used in the aerospace industry that does not chip, crack, peel, break, or tarnish and retains heat and cold, this object was manufactured relatively inexpensively using digital production technologies.

Its name a blend of Hollywood and garbage, the sculptural, translucent  Garbo  wastebasket that Rashid designed for Umbra in 1995 has also been used variously as a clothes hamper, flower vase, and champagne cooler. For Rashid, its highly tactile polypropylene material proved an excellent medium in which to explore ideas of dematerialization.  You feel in a sense that there is very little there,  he said of Garbo,  yet it is so flexible that basically it's indestructible. 
The  Aura  table's glass sheets are manually colored with water-based paints. Each sheet can be placed on any level and rotated to create twenty-four configurations.
This handcrafted paper lamp--its design based on traditional Japanese lanterns--reflects the lifelong interest of Isamu Noguchi in the integration of light and sculpture. Given the name
The sculptor Isamu Noguchi designed this lamp, one of a series inspired by traditional Japanese lanterns. He named the lamps akari, which means  the light of illumination  and  the essence of lightness. 
Eero Saarinen's  Pedestal  chair, introduced in 1957, was an instant success. This  Champagne  chair is one of the many variations on that design created in the late 1950s and 1960s.
Interested in designing a stylish, inexpensive chair, Rashid borrowed the curves, open spaces, and translucent polypropylene material from his  Garbo  wastebasket to create  Oh.  When introduced in January of 1999 at the price of forty-five dollars, the chair found a ready market; fifty thousand  Oh  chairs sold in the first three weeks of availability.
Its name a blend of Hollywood and garbage, the sculptural, translucent  Garbo  wastebasket that Rashid designed for Umbra in 1995 has also been used variously as a clothes hamper, flower vase, and champagne cooler. For Rashid, its highly tactile polypropylene material proved an excellent medium in which to explore ideas of dematerialization.  You feel in a sense that there is very little there,  he said of Garbo,  yet it is so flexible that basically it's indestructible.

In 1980, Venturi sent Alessi a proposal for this  stylized traditional  service, in which every piece was inspired by a silver form from a different historical period. Each was intended to be decorated according to its historical model and colored.  You will see that I have kept the historical symbolism,  Venturi wrote to Alessi,  but made the aesthetic involve a more disparate eclecticism with a more or less Rococo coffee pot, a Queen Anne tea pot, a Neo-Classical sugar bowl and Art Nouveau cream pitcher. The Piazza Campidoglio remains the tray.  The service was introduced in 1983.

Venturi translated the carved ornament of an eighteenth-century Sheraton chair into a two-dimensional, stenciled pattern, producing a gentle parodya cartoon composition of elementary lines, shapes, and colors.
Like the dashes in the Grandmother fabric, the Notebook pattern was inspired by standard stationers' supplies, but according to Denise Scott Brown, it evolved  to look more like the black-and-white blobs on the covers of composition notebooks that American children use in school. 
The Grandmother design was adapted from a flowered tablecloth that had belonged to an associate's grandmother. A pattern of black dashes, inspired by the conventional lining of business envelopes, was superimposed over the floral design.  We wanted a pattern here that was explicitly pretty in its soft, curvy configurations and sweet combinations of colors,  Venturi wrote,  and represented as well something with nice associations, those of flowers. By juxtaposing the two patterns, the dashes and grandmother-tablecloth, we achieved design involving dramatic contrasts of scale, rhythm, color, and association. 
This chair was hand-painted by the Philadelphia artist R. Michael Wommack for the first public exhibition of the firm's Knoll furniture at the Knoll showroom in New York in May 1984. The allover design was adapted from an abstract, multicolored pattern by the Italian designer Paola Navone, who was inspired in its creation by television static.
